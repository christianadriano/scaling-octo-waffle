This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{generate data}

x <- rnorm(n=1000, mean = 0,sd=5)
y <- rnorm(n=1000, mean = 0,sd=15)
x_z_scaled <- scale(x,center = TRUE, scale=TRUE)
y_z_scaled <- scale(y,center = TRUE, scale=TRUE)


```

##Confirming that new standard deviations are unitary
```{Statistics}
sd(x_z)
sd(y_z)
``` 


## Plots for visual comparison

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(x)
title(main="n=100, mean = 0,sd=10")
hist(y)
hist(x_z_scaled)
hist(y_z_scaled)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
